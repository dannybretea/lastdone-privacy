Privacy Policy — LastDone

Last updated: January 2026

LastDone is designed to be a quiet, privacy-respecting utility. We collect as little data as possible and do not track users.

Information We Do Not Collect

LastDone does not collect, store, or sell personal information such as:

Name

Email address

Phone number

Contacts

Location data

Photos or media

Usage analytics

Advertising identifiers

We do not use ads, trackers, or third-party analytics SDKs.

Information We Use (Minimal & Technical)

To support optional features like shared spaces and notifications, LastDone uses a small amount of non-personal technical data:

Anonymous user identifiers
Used to associate a device with shared spaces when syncing is enabled.

Push notification tokens
Used only to deliver reminders and shared space updates.

These identifiers:

Do not identify you personally

Are not used for tracking or advertising

Are used only for core app functionality

Local Data Storage

By default, LastDone works entirely locally on your device.

You can:

Use the app without creating an account

Add items, reminders, and notes without any data leaving your device

Shared Spaces & Syncing

If you choose to use shared spaces:

Data is synced only between invited members

Shared space data is encrypted

LastDone cannot read or access the contents of your shared data

Sign-in is required only to enable shared spaces and syncing.

Calendar Access

If you tap “Add to Calendar”, LastDone opens your device’s system calendar interface.

Calendar events are created only with your confirmation

LastDone does not read or modify your calendar data

Notifications

LastDone sends notifications only for reminders you have set.

Notifications are non-repeating

No notification data is used for tracking or analytics

Account Deletion

If you create an account for shared spaces, you can delete it at any time.

Deleting your account:

Removes your anonymous identifier

Removes your notification token

Removes your access to shared spaces

Shared spaces continue to exist for other members.

Children’s Privacy
